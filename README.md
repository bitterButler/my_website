# My First Website 

## First version
1. Added sections and divs for About me, Hobbies. Languages, F1 ...
2. Styled with only CSS.
3. Not finished

## Future Plans
- Rebuilding my page is under construction.
- Used Bootstrap
- Make it dynamic/interactive with JS. (added first dice game via JS)

## More ideas for future:
- Make it a password locked site. (this would appear first, and after unlocking would show the actual page)
- Add more games (anything, like a pac-man or snake game for example)
- Make something (or the game so) that it can use Databases, to save something.  


### Trying and using Git commands:
- git init
- git status
- git add
- git commit
- git branch (first time)
- git switch (first time)
- git push
- git merge (will be used in the future)
