# My First Website 

UPDATE: 2024.04.03.: 
- Hosted the "newVersion" branch with GithubPAGES for first time in my life.
- hosted website, had issues with loading images -> fixed
- hosted website, had issues with images inside JS (at manipulation) -> fixed


## First version
1. Added sections and divs for About me, Hobbies. Languages, F1 ...
2. Styled with only CSS.
3. Not finished

## newVersion branch
1. Rebuilt from scratch. Added (from bootstrap) navbar, sections, divs for About me, Hobbies. Languages, F1 ...
2. Styled with Bootstrap and own CSS (where needed). (somewhat responsive for different window-sizes)
3. Added JS code (for Dice/Voice Games), for buttons, EventListeners, sounds and image files (+manipulating). 
4. Needs fine-adjustment for the content.  

## More ideas for future:
- Make it a password locked site or login-based. (this would appear first, and after unlocking/registration would show the actual page)
- Add more games (anything, like a pac-man or snake game for example)
- Make something (or the game so) that it can use Databases, to save something.  


### Trying and using Git commands:
- git init
- git status
- git add . 
- git remote add origin https://github.com/username/....
- git commit -m ""
- git branch
- git switch 
- git remove rm [main/newVersion or your branch-name]
- git push (-u origin master)
- git merge (will be used in the future)
