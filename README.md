# My First Website 

## First version
1. Added sections and divs for About me, Hobbies. Languages, F1 ...
2. Styled with only CSS.
3. Not finished

## Future Plans
- Rebuild my page with Grid and Flexbox.
- Use Bootstrap (framework)
- Make it dynamic/interactive with JS.

## More ideas for future:
- Make it a password locked site. (this would appear first, and after unlocking would show the actual page)
- Add a game (anything)
- Make something (or the game so) that it can use Databases, to save something.  


### Trying and using Git commands:
- git init
- git status
- git add
- git commit
- git branch (first time)
- git switch (first time)
- git push
- git merge (will be used in the future)
