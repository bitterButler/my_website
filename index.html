    <h1 class="h1_aboutme"> [ ABOUT ME ]</h1>
     <div class="aboutme-text">
      <p>I am a hardworking and dedicated individual with no experience in life, just kidding. 
        Resided in Austria (Muckendorf-Wipfing) for a few years (Volksschule Zeiselmauer), meanwhile I learned the German language. 
      After that I attended a Hungarian High School. At this time I started reselling exclusive, limited edition sneakers. 
      I'm a tech guy, who likes F1, reading, but the gym occupies a portion of my free time as well. 
      I really like *szarakodni* when something interests me. Built my own custom mechanical keyboard with Gateron Inks and because i like pain & suffering, 
      i hand-lubed all the switches 1 by 1. Currently dipping my toes into the world of Simulator Racing. </p><br>
      <p class="extra-info"> <span class="span2">szarakodni:</span> is used by Hungarians as a common phrase. Most closest meaning is “i like to fuck around” with things. 
      But of course it has negative meaning as well. For example “dont be a dick” can mean “you should not szarakodni”. 
      Feel free to translate it, there are many ways to tell this. </p>

      <p>When i was a kid, i always had this idea in my mind, that i would like to have a nice keyboard collection. 
        A collection where I look for groupbuys, hand pick every part for it and at the end of the road build it by myself. 
        It might sound like it has no logical reasoning behind it, but i really dont give a flying peeeeps. Why? Because I am enjoying it to the fullest as of right now. 
        <br> This is my keyboard journey: 3€ board -> Logitech G610 -> Mode Envoy (soldered myself) -> Coming Soon. </p>

      <p>I enjoy learning new languages. Currently I am in the process of learning Japanese.
        It is acutally really hard, despite the fact that this language is similar in some aspects to the Hungarian language. Started with Duolingo and with some online resources.
        For me its fun, but it has some challenge to it aswell. (this is why I enjoy programming too) Japanese language has 3 types of "abc", if i can call it so.
        Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji. 
        Most resources recommend to start with Hiragana. So thats what i did. Kanji is harder, because its based on symbols which represents words or ideas. </p>

      <p>I always liked cars since the beginning of my birth. One of my favorite film of all time is “Cars” from Pixar. But you know, it had a different meaning back then. 
        Recently i had the opportunity to watch it again, and it was all fun and joy, but the meaning of the film was something else, much deeper, maybe because I am now a young adult? Not sure. 
        Back to F1. It's all about racing, so there is quite a lot of excitement of course. 
        But there are occasions where the weekend is so boring that i take a nap in between the live racing.  </p>
